<p>The Introduction to Data Science for Public Policy (<strong>PPOL 670-01</strong>) is a survey course of the fundamentals of data science. The course is focused on evaluating and analyzing public policy, telling stories with data to make compelling and fact-based arguments.</p>
<p>The objective of the course to equip students with the skills to tell stories with data and drive action. Public policy is part of a large and sprawling social system. Parsing causality from a system of variables where everything is related requires a scalpel. This refined approach can be assembled from pre-written code and routines; but it still requires skilled assembly. We will teach an approach that leverages analytical routines that have already been written. The value of this course is in the mortar, not the bricks.</p>

<h4 id="provosts-policy-accommodating-students-religious-observances">Provosts Policy Accommodating Students Religious Observances</h4>
<p>Georgetown University promotes respect for all religions. Any student who is unable to attend classes or to participate in any examination, presentation, or assignment on a given day because of the observance of a major religious holiday (see below) or related travel shall be excused and provided with the opportunity to make up, without unreasonable burden, any work that has been missed for this reason and shall not in any other way be penalized for the absence or rescheduled work. Students will remain responsible for all assigned work. Students should notify professors in writing at the beginning of the semester of religious observances that conflict with their classes. The Office of the Provost, in consultation with Campus Ministry and the Registrar, will publish, before classes begin for a given term, a list of major religious holidays likely to affect Georgetown students. The Provost and the Main Campus Executive Faculty encourage faculty to accommodate students whose bona fide religious observances in other ways impede normal participation in a course. Students who cannot be accommodated should discuss the matter with an advising dean.</p>
